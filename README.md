# Multiplayer-Something
I wanna try do some networking as practice for a multiplayer game some time in the future. Let's see how much I can fuck this up. I didn't do well in telecomms in college.

## PLAN
I HAVE NO IDEA

alright, I guess I should choose between p2p or server/host. server/host might be best? dunno if I like the idea of a p2p game

- mb start with a chat client?
- OH JESUS DO I HAVE TO MULTITHREAD

## How to use
- Install MinGW/MSYS (need MSYS)
- run server with command: .\networking.exe 0
- run client with command: .\networking 1 (your ip)
- idk why but localhost doesn't work for me, gotta grab ip (cmd line ipconfig)
- :D
